Recent increase in use of RL, and specifically DRL, in real-world scenarios is promoting the need for an approach to systematic software testing of DRL-based applications. Multiple approaches to testing DNN, an integral part of DRL, have been proposed, but their applicability to DRL has not been investigated. Specifically, neuron coverage in DNN is thought to be a valid test adequacy metric, as in DNN more extensive coverage allows the network to be trained for edge cases. In this study, we investigate whether neuron coverage is a suitable metric for DRL testing approaches. As DRL relies on the environment reward to infer the desired behavior, we evaluate whether neuron coverage could be considered an adequate metric, if it is correlated with the rewards obtained by the DRL system. To that effect, we investigate the relationship between multiple aspects of neuron coverage and the rewards in 19 different DRL systems, selected to cover the range of DNN architectures and reward models. We found no evidence of correlation between neuron coverage and higher rewards in DRL, suggesting that in DRL neuron coverage alone cannot be considered a suitable metric for test adequacy.
